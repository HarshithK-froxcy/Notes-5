 
#  Experiment A2 — GitHub Operations: Fork, Merge, Diff, Merge Conflict, Branch, and Pull Request 

## **Objective**
To demonstrate collaborative development and version management using **GitHub**, by performing key operations such as `fork`, `merge`, `diff`, `merge conflict`, `branch`, and `pull request`.

 

## **Software Requirements**
- **Operating System:** Windows / Linux  
- **Tools:** Git Bash, GitHub Account, Web Browser  
- **Version Control:** Git  

 

## **Procedure**

### **Step 1 — Fork a Repository**

**Definition:**  
A **fork** is a copy of a repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

**Steps:**
1. Log in to your **GitHub** account.  
2. Navigate to the repository you want to fork.  
3. Click on the **“Fork”** button at the top-right corner of the page.  
4. GitHub will create a personal copy of that repository under your account.  

 

### **Step 2 — Clone the Forked Repository**

Clone the forked repository to your local machine using Git Bash.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/RepositoryName.git
$ cd RepositoryName
````

 

### **Step 3 — Create and Switch to a New Branch**

Branches allow multiple lines of development to exist simultaneously.

```bash
$ git branch new_feature
$ git checkout new_feature
```

Or, create and switch in one command:

```bash
$ git checkout -b new_feature
```

Verify the branch:

```bash
$ git branch
```

 

### **Step 4 — Modify Files**

Edit or create a file in the repository. For example:

```bash
$ echo "This is a new feature file" > feature.txt
```

Stage and commit the changes:

```bash
$ git add feature.txt
$ git commit -m "Added new feature file"
```

 

### **Step 5 — Merge Branches**

Switch back to the main branch and merge the feature branch.

```bash
$ git checkout master
$ git merge new_feature
```

If the merge is successful, it will display a “Fast-forward” message.

 

### **Step 6 — Demonstrate Merge Conflict**

To intentionally cause a conflict:

```bash
$ mkdir git-merge-test
$ cd git-merge-test
$ git init
$ echo "this is some content to mess with" > merge.txt
$ git add merge.txt
$ git commit -am "initial commit"

$ git checkout -b new_branch_to_merge_later
$ echo "totally different content to merge later" > merge.txt
$ git commit -am "edited merge.txt to cause conflict"

$ git checkout master
$ echo "conflicting content in master branch" > merge.txt
$ git commit -am "conflicting change in master"

$ git merge new_branch_to_merge_later
```

**Output:**

```
Auto-merging merge.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in merge.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit result.
```

To resolve:

1. Open `merge.txt`, edit the conflicting sections manually.
2. After resolving:

   ```bash
   $ git add merge.txt
   $ git commit -m "resolved merge conflict"
   ```

 

### **Step 7 — Use Git Diff**

To compare file changes between commits or branches:

```bash
$ git diff
```

To compare specific branches:

```bash
$ git diff master new_feature
```

 

### **Step 8 — Push Changes to Remote**

Push your local changes to the remote GitHub repository.

```bash
$ git push origin master
```

Or if pushing a branch:

```bash
$ git push origin new_feature
```

 

### **Step 9 — Create a Pull Request (PR)**

A **Pull Request (PR)** allows you to propose changes from your branch or fork to the original repository.

**Steps:**

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click on **“Pull Requests” → “New Pull Request.”**
3. Select the base repository and branch (original repo) and compare it with your feature branch.
4. Add a title and description for your PR.
5. Click **“Create Pull Request.”**

Once reviewed and approved, the repository owner can merge your changes.

 

## **Expected Output**

* Successful **fork** of a repository on GitHub.
* **New branch** created, modified, and merged successfully.
* **Merge conflict** identified and resolved manually.
* **Diff** command displayed differences between versions.
* **Pull Request** raised and visible on GitHub.

 

## **Result**

Successfully demonstrated collaborative GitHub operations including:
`fork`, `branch`, `merge`, `diff`, `merge conflict`, and `pull request`.
The experiment validates understanding of distributed version control and team-based project workflows.
