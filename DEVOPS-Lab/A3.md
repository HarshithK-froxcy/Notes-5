 
#  Experiment A3 — Integration of GitHub Repository with Jenkins for CI/CD Pipeline

## **Objective**
To demonstrate the process of integrating a **GitHub repository** with **Jenkins** to automate project execution within a **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipeline.



## **Software Requirements**
- **Operating System:** Windows 10 / 11 (64-bit recommended)  
- **Tools:**  
  - Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or later)  
  - Jenkins (LTS version for Windows)  
  - Git Bash  
  - Python Interpreter  
  - Web Browser (Chrome / Edge)  
  - Active GitHub Account  



## **Procedure**

### **Step 1 — Install Java Development Kit (JDK)**
Jenkins requires Java to run. Install and configure it properly.

1. Download **JDK 8 or higher** from the official Oracle website.  
2. Choose the Windows version (32-bit or 64-bit) as per your system configuration.  
3. Accept the license agreement and complete the installation.

**Configure Environment Variables:**
1. Go to **System Properties → Advanced → Environment Variables.**  
2. Under **System Variables**, click **New** and set:
   - **Variable Name:** `JAVA_HOME`
   - **Variable Value:** Path to your JDK installation folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_202`)  
3. Edit the **Path** variable and add:
```

%JAVA_HOME%\bin

````
4. Verify the installation:
```bash
java -version
````



### **Step 2 — Download and Install Jenkins**

1. Download **Jenkins LTS for Windows** from the official Jenkins website.
2. Extract and install the downloaded file by following the on-screen instructions.
3. Once installed, click **Finish**.



### **Step 3 — Run Jenkins on Localhost**

1. Open your browser and type:

   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```
2. Enter the **admin credentials** provided during installation.
3. On first login, Jenkins will prompt to **install recommended plugins** — select this option.
4. Once setup is complete, you’ll see the **Jenkins Dashboard**.



### **Step 4 — Explore Jenkins Interface**

* **New Item:** Create a new project.
* **Build History:** Displays all executed builds with status.
* **Manage Jenkins:** Central configuration hub for plugins and system setup.



### **Step 5 — Build and Run a Sample Job**

1. Click on **“New Item”** and provide a project name — for example, `Jenkins_Demo`.
2. Choose **Freestyle Project** and click **OK**.
3. Under the **General** tab, add a description:

   ```
   This is my first Jenkins job.
   ```
4. Navigate to **Build Triggers → Add build step → Execute Windows batch command**.
5. Enter the following command:

   ```bash
   echo "Hello... This is my first Jenkins Demo: %date% : %time%"
   ```
6. Click **Apply → Save**.
7. Select **Build Now** and observe the process in the **Console Output** section.
   You should see the message displayed with current date and time.



### **Step 6 — Prepare Your GitHub Project**

1. Install **Python** on your local system.
2. Write and test a Python script (e.g., `hello.py`):

   ```python
   print("Hello from Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline!")
   ```
3. Initialize a local Git repository and push it to your GitHub account:

   ```bash
   $ git init
   $ git add hello.py
   $ git commit -m "Initial Python script commit"
   $ git branch -M master
   $ git remote add origin https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/JenkinsDemo.git
   $ git push -u origin master
   ```



### **Step 7 — Configure Jenkins Project with GitHub**

1. Launch **Jenkins Dashboard**.
2. Click **New Item → Freestyle Project** (e.g., `GitHub_Pipeline`).
3. Under **Source Code Management**, select **Git**.
4. In the repository URL field, enter your GitHub repository link:

   ```
   https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/JenkinsDemo.git
   ```
5. Specify the branch name as:

   ```
   master
   ```



### **Step 8 — Set Build Triggers**

To automate the build based on GitHub updates:

1. In the **Build Triggers** section, check:

   ```
   Poll SCM
   ```
2. Configure the schedule according to your needs (e.g., check for changes every minute):

   ```
   * * * * *
   ```



### **Step 9 — Define Build Steps**

1. Scroll down to the **Build** section.
2. Select **Execute Windows batch command**.
3. Add the following command to execute your Python script:

   ```bash
   python hello.py
   ```
4. Click **Apply → Save**.



### **Step 10 — Run and Verify Build**

1. Click **Build Now** from the Jenkins project dashboard.
2. Wait for the build to complete.
3. Check the **Console Output** for execution results:

   ```
   Hello from Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline!
   ```
4. Verify that the build status shows **Success (blue check mark)**.



## **Expected Output**

* Jenkins successfully installed and configured.
* GitHub repository integrated with Jenkins.
* Automated pipeline triggered via **Poll SCM** configuration.
* Python script executed automatically through Jenkins build process.



## **Result**

Successfully demonstrated the integration of a **GitHub repository** with **Jenkins** to automate project execution in a **CI/CD pipeline**.
The setup validates continuous integration, automated testing, and deployment workflow using Git, Jenkins, and Python.
